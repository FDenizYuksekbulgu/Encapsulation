# Encapsulation

In this example, a Car class was created.

Properties of the Car class -> Brand, Model, Color, Number of Doors

Encapsulation was performed for the number of doors.

When the Car object is created, if a value other than 2 or 4 is assigned for the Number of Doors, a warning message is displayed on the console screen and the Number of Doors value is assigned as -1.
